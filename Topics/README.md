# 🧩 Jenkins — Introduction (Day 1)

---

## 💡 What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an **open-source automation server** used to build **CI/CD pipelines**.  
It automates repetitive tasks like:  
- 🔄 **Build**  
- 🧪 **Test**  
- 📦 **Package**  
- 🚀 **Deploy**  

**Goal:** Deliver software **faster and more reliably**.

---

## 🎯 Why Jenkins is Important in DevOps
✅ Key Features:  
- ⚙️ Automation of repeated tasks  
- 🔌 Thousands of plugins (Git, Docker, AWS, K8s, etc.)  
- 🧱 Pipeline-as-Code using `Jenkinsfile`  
- 👥 Distributed builds using **agents/nodes**  
- 📈 Detailed build history and logs

---

## 🔥 Key Terms You Must Know
**🟦 CI (Continuous Integration)**  
- Developers push code frequently  
- Automated builds + tests  
- ✅ Detect bugs early  

**🟩 CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**  
- Delivery: code is always ready for deployment  
- Deployment: automatic deployment to production  

---

## 🏗️ Jenkins Architecture (High-Level)
**Controller (Master)**  
- 🗂️ Manages jobs/pipelines  
- 👤 Handles UI, plugins, scheduling  
- 📌 Distributes work to agents  

**Agents (Nodes)**  
- 🏃 Run actual builds/tests  
- 💡 Enable parallel builds  
- 🧩 Can be Linux/Windows/Docker/K8s based  

---

## ⭐ Jenkins Workflow (Simple Flow)
1️⃣ Developer pushes code to GitHub/GitLab  
2️⃣ Webhook triggers Jenkins build  
3️⃣ Jenkins builds the application  
4️⃣ Jenkins runs automated tests  
5️⃣ Creates artifacts / Docker image  
6️⃣ Deploys to server/cloud/Kubernetes  

---

## ✅ Where Jenkins is Used?
- 🌐 Web app deployment  
- 📦 Docker image build & push  
- ☁️ Cloud deployments (AWS/Azure/GCP)  
- ☸️ Kubernetes CI/CD pipelines  
- 🔍 Code Quality checks (SonarQube)  
- 🔐 DevSecOps pipelines (SAST/DAST tools)  

---

## 💡 Pro Tip (Portfolio Boost)
- Include **Jenkinsfile examples**  
- Showcase **mini CI/CD projects** (Docker + AWS/K8s)  
- Makes recruiters notice your practical skills
